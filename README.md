# Network Engineering Portfolio
**By Abdelrahman ElGabry**

## 👨‍💻 About Me
Welcome to my technical portfolio. I am an aspiring Network Engineer passionate about designing scalable, secure, and efficient network infrastructures. This repository documents my hands-on simulations, lab experiments, and design projects using Cisco Packet Tracer and other networking tools.

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate my practical understanding of routing protocols, switching concepts, WAN technologies, and network troubleshooting.
