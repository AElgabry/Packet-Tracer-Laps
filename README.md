This project simulates a segmented network infrastructure for a Small-to-Medium Enterprise (SME) designed in Cisco Packet Tracer. The topology utilizes a Router-on-a-Stick architecture to manage traffic between three distinct departments (HR, IT, and Sales) while implementing Layer 2 security measures at the access level.🏗 Network ArchitectureCore/Routing Layer: A Cisco 2901 Router handles Inter-VLAN routing using sub-interfaces and acts as the DHCP server for the network.Distribution Layer: A Cisco 3650 Multilayer Switch aggregates traffic from the access layer switches.Access Layer: Two Cisco 2960 switches provide end-user connectivity with Port Security enabled to prevent unauthorized access.🔧 Key Features & TechnologiesVLAN Segmentation: Traffic is logically separated into three VLANs to isolate departmental data.Inter-VLAN Routing: Configured via 802.1Q trunking (Router-on-a-Stick) on the central router.Dynamic Addressing (DHCP): The router manages three separate DHCP pools to automatically assign IP addresses to devices in each VLAN.Layer 2 Security:Port Security: Enabled on access ports with violation restrict mode.Sticky MAC: Dynamically learns and saves MAC addresses to the running configuration to prevent MAC spoofing.EtherChannel: Link aggregation (LACP/PAgP) is configured to bundle physical links for increased bandwidth and redundancy between switches.📊 VLAN ConfigurationDepartmentVLAN IDNetwork SubnetGatewayHR1010.0.0.0/810.0.0.1IT2020.0.0.0/820.0.0.1Sales3030.0.0.0/830.0.0.1📄 Device Configuration HighlightsRouter0 (Inter-VLAN Routing & DHCP):Sub-interfaces (g0/0.10, g0/0.20, g0/0.30) configured with Dot1Q encapsulation.Excluded addresses x.x.x.1 through x.x.x.20 for static assignment.Access Switches (SW1 & SW2):Access Ports: Assigned to specific VLANs based on department.Security: switchport port-security mac-address sticky ensures only authorized devices connect.
